Fun NFT phython ART generator inspired by Pixegami's 
"How to create NFT generative art using Python"

This is the initial version - I plan on experimenting more with the ImageDraw module using randomization. Once I have something I like, I plan on introducing some weak ML, generate a ton of images, and use ML to categorize and filter out a style I prefer! 

Stay tuned!

#dependencies
Make sure to install these modules using pip before running

pandas
numpy
tensorflow
opencv-python
matplotlib

Highly recommend you install CUDA 11.2 & cuDNN 8.1 (NOTE IT MUST BE THE EXACT VERSION) to utilize your GPU 
for training if you so desire. Tensorflow training on a CPU is MUCH slower than GPU.
